# Introduction

This will be one step forward towards my goal of Timeless-RPG. This
experimental library will create useful bindings to general UI, and
specifically for SDL2. Once this library is done, I should get a good
idea of how FRP GUIs should look like, and proceed to the next step. I
may split this into Timeless-UI and Timeless-SDL in the future, and
may actually make something like Timeless-GTK or Timeless-WX, but for
now, I will concentrate on my short term goal -- game making. So, SDL2!

# Goal

I will try to make them as Arrowic as possible. At the same time, I
expect this project to inject lots of hot fresh code into the core
Timeless library. If performance bottleneck hits somehow, I will try
to work on parallel evaluation of Timeless core. Otherwise, I concern
nothing about performance.

# Expectations

Don't expect to use this in your projects yet. It is experimental, and
is intended to be discarded after I gain knowledge. Unless it turns
out to be wayyyy too good to be thrown away, I will stop maintaining
it after I finish experimenting with things, or when I no longer have
the need to write anything using Timeless.

# Note to self

Unless I completely rewrite that SDL2-ttf, I am no going to add font
support
right now.
